Researched git submodule problem of commits. 
Artcles printed on memory calculations using PIN as well as the overhead created.

Was looking into the load and store instruction counting. 
The footprint.H file in Memory looks promising as it contains a call to load and stores. 
Problem is that the loads may be double counted. I think if we subtract the load and store(3) from the total it will account for the duplication.
