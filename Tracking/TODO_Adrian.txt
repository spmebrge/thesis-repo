find Pin tool to count 
#of Mem calls
#basic blocks
#basic block freq
#instuction calls
#function calls
#function call freq

run with genorator_seq [5-10] -e 4 Kronecker graph with above
then increase edges to
 8, 
16, 
32.

Draw the graph (as line graph)
x-axis: #nodes,
y-axis: #MEM instructions (for example)
4 lines because edges changed

Then other graphs for other metrics like func. calls, BB, etc.
