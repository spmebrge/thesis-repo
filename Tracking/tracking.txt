To build and run a sample tool on Linux*:

    cd source/tools/SimpleExamples
    make obj-intel64/opcodemix.so
    ../../../pin -t obj-intel64/opcodemix.so -- /bin/ls

    This will instrument and run /bin/ls, the output for this tool is in
    opcodemix.out.

Building and Running examples:
We navigated to cd source/tools/ManualExamples
Then use 
$make [filename].test
and this will create a .so file in the obj-intel64 directory of your current directory. For exampe:
$make inscount2.test

Afterwards run
The output file is in inscount.out
$../../../pin -t obj-intel64/inscount2.so -- /bin/ls
This will run the file you just made using the pin tool.

Count Intructions/Basic Blocks/Threads
The output file needs to be specified. In this case it is '-o out.txt' for convenience.
$/home/kaya1/aavila/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux/source/tools/MyPinTool
$make all
$../../../pin -t obj-intel64/MyPinTool.so -o out.txt -- /bin/ls

Count number of functions with how many instructions in each
The output file is in the same directory under proccount.out
$make proccount.test 
$../../../pin -t obj-intel64/proccount.so -- /bin/ls
$vi proccount.out
